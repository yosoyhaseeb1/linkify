Job search URLs are not supported - please provide a single, specific job posting."},{question:"How long does a run take?",answer:"Most runs complete in 2-3 minutes. The process includes analyzing the job posting, finding decision makers via Apollo, generating personalized messages, and creating a campaign in HeyReach. Complex runs may take up to 5 minutes."},{question:"Why is my campaign paused by default?",answer:"Campaigns are created in a paused state to allow you to review the prospects and messages before activating. This gives you full control and ensures quality. You can activate the campaign directly in HeyReach when ready."},{question:"What happens if my session expires?",answer:"For security, sessions automatically expire after 30 minutes of inactivity. You'll see a notification and be prompted to sign in again. Your work is saved, so you can continue where you left off. Press Ctrl+Shift+T to test the session timeout modal."},{question:"What happens if I hit my usage limit?",answer:"If you reach your monthly limit for runs or prospects, you won't be able to create new runs until your billing period resets. You can upgrade your plan at any time in the Billing section, or contact support for assistance."},{question:"How do I connect HeyReach and Apollo?",answer:`Go to the Integrations page and click "Connect" for each service. You'll be redirected to authorize the connection. Both integrations are required for the platform to function properly.`},{question:"Can I customize the message templates?",answer:"Currently, messages are auto-generated based on the job posting and prospect information. Custom templates and advanced personalization will be available in a future update. Contact support if you need specific messaging requirements."},{question:"What if a run fails?",answer:"Common failure reasons include: Apollo API limits reached, invalid job post URL, or integration connection issues. Check the error message on the run detail page for specific guidance. Most issues resolve within 24 hours, or you can contact support."},{question:"How do team seats work?",answer:"Each plan includes a certain number of seats. Admin users can invite team members from the Team page. Members can create runs and view data, while Admins have full access including billing and team management."}];return e.jsxs("div",{className:"p-8 max-w-4xl mx-auto",children:[e.jsxs("div",{className:"mb-8",children:[e.jsx("h1",{children:"Help & Support"}),e.jsx("p",{className:"text-muted-foreground mt-2",children:"Find answers to common questions or contact our support team"})]}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-12",children:[e.jsx("a",{href:"mailto:support@linkedinautomation.com",className:"glass-card p-6 rounded-xl hover:bg-accent/20 transition-colors group",children:e.jsxs("div",{className:"flex items-center gap-4",children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"w-12 h-12 rounded-lg bg-primary/10 flex items-center justify-center group-hover:scale-110 transition-transform",children:e.jsx(c,{className:"w-6 h-6 text-primary"})}),e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx("h3",{children:"Email Support"}),e.jsx("p",{className:"text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1",children:"support@linkedinautomation.com"}),e.jsx("p",{className:"text-xs text-muted-foreground mt-1",children:"Response within 24 hours"})]})]})}),e.jsx("a",{href:"https://docs.linkedinautomation.com",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",className:"glass-card p-6 rounded-xl hover:bg-accent/20 transition-colors group",children:e.jsxs("div",{className:"flex items-center gap-4",children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"w-12 h-12 rounded-lg bg-info/10 flex items-center justify-center group-hover:scale-110 transition-transform",children:e.jsx(d,{className:"w-6 h-6 text-info"})}),e.jsxs("div",{children:[e.jsx("h3",{children:"Documentation"}),e.jsx("p",{className:"text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1",children:"Guides and tutorials"}),e.jsx("p",{className:"text-xs text-muted-foreground mt-1",children:"Complete platform documentation"})]})]})})]}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"glass-card p-8 rounded-xl",children:[e.jsxs("div",{className:"flex items-center gap-3 mb-6",children:[e.jsx(m,{className:"w-6 h-6 text-primary"}),e.jsx("h2",{children:"Frequently Asked Questions"})]}),e.jsx("div",{className:"space-y-3",children:o.map((a,s)=>e.jsxs("div",{className:"border-b border-border last:border-0",children:[e.jsxs("button",{onClick:()=>n(t===s?null:s),className:"w-full flex items-center justify-between py-4 text-left hover:text-primary transition-colors",children:[e.jsx("h3",{children:a.question}),t===s?e.jsx(u,{className:"w-5 h-5 flex-shrink-0"}):e.jsx(l,{className:"w-5 h-5 flex-shrink-0"})]}),t===s&&e.jsx("div",{className:"pb-4",children:e.jsx("p",{className:"text-muted-foreground",children:a.answer})})]},s))})]}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"mt-8 p-6 glass-card rounded-xl border-l-4 border-info",children:[e.jsx("h3",{className:"mb-2",children:"Not finding what you need?"}),e.jsxs("p",{className:"text-muted-foreground mb-4",children:["Our support team is here to help.
